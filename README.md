shapes
======

It is a programming exercise using plain Java SE with a Maven skeleton. 

The program uses the command line to generate 2D shapes and check whether 
points are enveloped by these shapes in an XY coordinate system.
It is very simple and it doesn't use any thick clients such as AWT, apart from JUnit.
